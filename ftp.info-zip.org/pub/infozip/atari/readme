This directory contains executables for Atari TOS.

   864 Feb 22 2004  README         what you're reading right now
155050 Feb 11 1994  unzip51b.tos   UnZip 5.1 exes & docs, self-extr. archive
151986 Feb 11 1994  unzip51b.zoo   UnZip 5.1 exes & docs, Zoo 2.1 format

The self-extracting archive was created with Vincent Pomey's ZIP2TOS.
Each archive contains executables built with GNU C 2.5.8 and the MiNT
library (patchlevel 41).  They will work fine with MiNT or regular TOS
(and probably things like Mag!x and Geneva) and there are 68020-and-up
optimized binaries for people with TTs, Falcons or accelerated STs.

All Info-ZIP packages contain documentation.  The sources are in ../src .
