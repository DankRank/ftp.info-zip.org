         File: zip-2.3.zip
       Author: Info-ZIP (http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/)
               BeOS port by Chris Herborth (chrish@pobox.com)
      Release: 2.3
Compatibility: R5 (x86 platform)
     Location: /pub/contrib/util/
  Description: Create and manipulate .zip files.  Supports file attributes.
        Notes: Zip 2.3, with support for BeOS file attributes.

 Installation: Unpack the archive (using unzip), and move the
               executables into /boot/home/config/bin.  You're done!  Be
               sure to read the documentation though; you're probably
               looking for the -y option (preserve symbolic links). :-)
			   And you want to use -r to store directories...
