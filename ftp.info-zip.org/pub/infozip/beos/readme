WARNING:  Starting with beta version 2.2j dr9 v3 of Zip, the BeOS data is
          stored in a new, safer way.  This makes it incompatible with the
          file attributes and type/creator codes stored in very old BeOS zip
          archives.  You WILL still be able to get the data out of these old
          archives.

          THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM UNLESS YOU HAVE VERY OLD BeOS ZIP FILES.

All Info-ZIP packages contain documentation.  The sources are in ../src .
BeOS port by Chris Herborth (chrish@pobox.com).
