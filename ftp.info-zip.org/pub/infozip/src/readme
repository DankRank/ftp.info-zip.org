Note that WiZ 5.03, the Windows 9x/NT graphical version of Zip/UnZip, now
includes the complete Zip 2.31 and UnZip 5.52 DLL sources; no other sources
are required to compile WiZ.  (The archive does not contain the COMPLETE source
code for Zip and UnZip, however--only the Win32-specific sources.)

Also note that Zip 2.32, UnZip 5.52, WiZ 5.03, and MacZip 1.04 all include
the full crypto source code (i.e., the contents of zcrypt.zip), although the
latter is still available separately for historical (and regulatory) reasons.
Both encryption and decryption are enabled by default in all source archives.

Thanks to Ryan Little (rlittle46@comcast.net) for the zipcontent.pl script,
which creates an indexable web page (HTML) containing the zipfile name, the
zipfile comment (if any), and its files.  (For full-text indexing, do a search
for zip2html--but note that its memory requirements can be quite large.)
