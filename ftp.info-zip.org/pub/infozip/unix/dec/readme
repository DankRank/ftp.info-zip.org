This directory contains executables for DEC/Compaq Digital Unix (a.k.a. DUX,
formerly OSF/1, and possibly a.k.a. Tru64 Unix) on Alpha AXP and for DEC Ultrix
on MIPS.

At least some of the DUX binaries were compiled under Digital Unix 4.0A with
DEC C V5.2-030.  (The UnZip 5.41 and Zip 2.3 binaries were downloaded from The
Written Word's Open Source site, http://www.thewrittenword.com/free/downloads/.)
The statically linked ones work under DUX 3.2 and 4.0; the dynamically linked
ones will only work under DUX 4.x.

The Ultrix binaries were compiled with GNU C 2.6.3 and are statically linked.
unz532x-ulx.zip is actually a self-extracting zipfile; if you don't have an
older copy of UnZip already, just set its permissions to executable (e.g., 755)
and run it to extract to the current directory.

All Info-ZIP packages contain documentation.  The sources are in ../../src .
