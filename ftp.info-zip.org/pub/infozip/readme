(Yes, we're fully aware that ftp.info-zip.org is located in Germany.  But
we also have mirror sites in the US and other countries.)

Encryption binaries are currently available only from our European site,
ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/infozip/ , but this will change in the near future.
Note that all UnZip-related binaries already contain (or are supposed to
contain) _de_cryption capability.
