This directory contains executables for MS-DOS / PC-DOS / DR-DOS / FreeDOS.
For 32-bit Windows systems you should look in ../WIN32.

The self-extracting files are in zip format.  You can use UnZip 5.x
or PKUNZIP 2.04g to extract them directly without running them, as in:

  unzip unz552x3.exe

The UnZip executables were compiled with MSC 8.0 (16-bit) and djgpp-gcc 3.03
(32-bit) or later.  They have been compressed using UPX 1.24.

The Zip package contains a 32-bit version of Zip (zip.exe); it's not
necessarily faster than the 16-bit version (and may in some cases be slower),
but it can process far more files without exhausting available memory.  It
is useful, for example, when using Zip to back up an entire disk.  The 16-bit
Zip executables (zip16.exe and/or zip16-sm.exe) were compiled with SMALL_MEM
defined to minimize out-of-memory problems.  Whenever possible, use zip.exe.

All Info-ZIP packages contain documentation.  The sources are in ../src .
