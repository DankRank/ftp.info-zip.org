These are BETA executables for MVS!  But they're all we have for now, unless
and until someone can try compiling the official Zip and UnZip sources and
test/fix things under MVS (we know there are a few bugs left).

These executables are provided without warranty, blah blah blah.  Use at
your own risk (but we believe them to be reasonably functional).

This directory contains the following files:
  
UNZ101.MVSMOD      - This is a MVS TRANSMIT packet file containing
                     the unzip load module.
                     Upload it with LRECL 80 RECFM FB and then
                     do under tso : RECEIVE INDSN(UNZ101.MVSMOD)
  
ZIP101.MVSMOD      - This is a MVS TRANSMIT packet file containing
