This directory contains executables for Windows CE for both MIPS/NEC
and Hitachi processors.  Note that Pocket UnZip 1.0 is Steve P. Miller's
graphical CE port of UnZip 5.3.

The following table lists the current crop of Windows CE devices and
which binaries they run:

     ---------------------    ------------    ---------------
     Philips Electronics      MIPS R3910      mips/punzip.exe
     NEC Corp.                NEC VR4101      mips/punzip.exe
     Casio Computer Co.       Hitachi SH-3    sh3/punzip.exe
     Compaq Computer Corp.    Hitachi SH-3    sh3/punzip.exe
     Hewlett-Packard Co.      Hitachi SH-3    sh3/punzip.exe
     Hitachi Ltd.             Hitachi SH-3    sh3/punzip.exe
     LG Electronics Inc.      Hitachi SH-3    sh3/punzip.exe

There are no self-extracting archives for Windows CE.  Bare executables are
provided in their place, with documentation in a separate archive (which
includes the help file, punzip.htp).  The help file is identical to the HTML
version:

    http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/punzip.html

Note that "punzip.exe" cannot be renamed or it will not work correctly.
The executable and "punzip.htp" must be put in the "\Windows" directory
on Windows CE or it might not work correctly.  "punzip.htp" is optional;
Pocket UnZip tests for its existence at startup.

Sources are in ../src .
