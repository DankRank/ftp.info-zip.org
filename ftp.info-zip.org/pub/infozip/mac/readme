MacZip is a graphical executable with integrated Zip and UnZip capability,
similar to WiZ for Win16 and Win32.  Version 1.05 is based on Zip 2.3 and
UnZip 5.41, and it is distributed in BinHex format.

The old UnZip 5.32 binary is essentially non-graphical and stores only minimal
Mac OS file attribute, but it may still be useful.  Its documentation is stored
in DOS format (CR/LF); extract with UnZip's text-conversion option (correspond-
ing to "-a" in command-line versions).  The UnZip sources are in ../src .
