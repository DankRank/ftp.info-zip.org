This version of UnZip has been compiled on SCO ODT 3.0 with max optimization
and compatibility options.  It has been run on a number of V.3.2 and V.4.x
systems without problems.

Zip executables were retrieved from ftp://ftp.celestial.com/pub/sco-ports/unix/
and repackaged in standard Info-ZIP format.  They do not support encryption.
Note that "zip -y" fails to store symbolic links properly in version 2.0.1.

All Info-ZIP packages contain documentation.  The sources are in ../../src .
