This is an AOS/VS CLI dump (that's a special-format archive) of the 
executables for ZIP and UNZIP (ZIP.PR & UNZIP.PR), plus the symbol tables 
(ZIP.ST & UNZIP.ST) plus the help files (which are just the man pages, 
with a few additions at the end).  These are from the old version, but 
they're what I have.  [...]

The reason for the dump is that AOS/VS has file types, & for the most 
part executables need to be one of a small set of types (I think).  [...]

It occurs to me too late that I should have dumped zip & unzip 
separately.  The opportunity to do so is about 3 file transfers back, I'm 
afraid.

[...]

Hope all this helps.  <sigh>

GRR 960204:  These are Zip 2.01 and UnZip 5.01.  These executables should
             be able to handle any current zipfile compression method.
