These are BETA executables for Novell Netware!  We don't even know what
version they work with (probably 3.x), but they're all we have for now.

These executables are provided without warranty, blah blah blah.  Use at
your own risk (but we believe them to be reasonably functional).

==============================================================================

The two Zip executables (Zip and ZipNote) are from a relatively recent
(March 1995) port of Zip "2.0j" beta from 16 September 1994.  The UnZip
executable is from the older 1993 port of UnZip 5.0.

The iz-novell.zip archive contains all three executables:
