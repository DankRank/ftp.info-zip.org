   Due to e-mail overload, in mid-2004 Jean-loup abandoned the zlib
   project and since then has been unresponsive (with one exception)
   even to Mark Adler, his co-maintainer, even in light of known security
   issues in zlib 1.2.1 (which, until a few days ago, was the last release
   on Jean-loup's site, known both as http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ and as
   http://www.zlib.org/).  THE ONLY OFFICIAL SITE FOR ZLIB is currently
   http://www.zlib.net/ , maintained by Mark Adler.  As of this writing,
   zlib 1.2.2 is the current release, with a non-security-related follow-on
   in development.  PLEASE UPDATE ALL OLD LINKS!

   Due to the ongoing networking problems at FreeSoftware.com, the former
   host for http://info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/, the official zlib site
   moved on 27 April 2001. The new site is http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ and is
   maintained by Jean-loup Gailly. Please make a note of it! _This_ site is
   no longer being updated (or mirrored from the new home site) and may go
   away in the future.
