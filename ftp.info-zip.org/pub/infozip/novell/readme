Thanks to Vance Baarda (VRB@novell.com) for doing/updating the Novell NetWare
port of UnZip and providing the binaries and notes.  See README.novell
(included in the zipfile) for installation notes and important information
about the differences between the three UnZip ports.

Note that both sets of BETA versions are of UNKNOWN QUALITY.  Also note that
the "beta2" binaries were retrieved from an external site and include no
information about who built them or what changes were made.  USE AT YOUR OWN
RISK!  (Vance's 5.40 port, on the other hand, apparently was considered good
enough that Novell bundled it with NetWare 5.1.)

All Info-ZIP packages contain documentation.  Sources are in ../src .
