177713 Dec  6 1999  zcr23xQ.zip      Zip 2.3 exes and docs (with encryption)

Note that the unsfx.bas BASIC program must be run on the self-extracting
UnZip 5.4 archive before the latter can run and extract itself.  This is
due to a QDOS design problem:  specifically, the data size (stack size) for
executables is stored in the QDOS directory entry rather than in the executable
itself.  The BASIC program is a way to work around this.

All Info-ZIP packages contain documentation.  The sources are in ../src .
