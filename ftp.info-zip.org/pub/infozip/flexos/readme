Thanks to Derek Fawcus (df@eyrie.demon.co.uk) for providing the FlexOS
binaries.  The source changes for the UnZip port will be incorporated into
the next public release (probably 5.32).  Here are his notes on the port:

              ---------------------------------------------

   This should be considered an initial port - there will probably be some
   bugs and non-functioning features.

   The only functionality which has had any real testing is "unzip filename",
   anything else is basically untested.

   This has been cross-compiled from DOS using Metaware's High C compiler
   and the DOS version of pamake (v3.0).  It should compile with the FlexOS-
   hosted version of HighC,  and the makefile could be converted to work
   with the native FlexOS make.

   The following considerations apply:

   )Compiled against and linked with portlib.
   )Used on FlexOS 286 v2.32
   )Volume labels are not supported - this is due to the way FlexOS decides
    if a drive has case sensitive filenames based upon the contents of the
    volume label.
   )No special handling for case-sensitive media (see above).
   )Not using the PORTLIB wildarg routine (i.e. unzip does its own globbing).
   )Based upon the MSDOS port.
   )Filenames are in FAT format.
   )The current version of getch is a cheat (simply using getchar()).  I
    should interrogate stdin and if it's a FlexOS console the use special
    code to turn off echo and just read one char.
   )Only the basic MSDOS FAT file attributes are saved/restored.  There is
    currently no support for the FlexOS extended file attributes.
   )There is some code which should attempt to do the correct thing when a
    pathspec with a logical name definition is used (e.g. "system:path/to/it")
    however it again has not been stress-tested.
   )There is no special handling for floppy drives,  there probably should
    be.
   )The dateformat is compiled in as DMY (shoot me I'm British),  I'm not
    sure if there is actually a way to get locale info.
   )The assembler speedups haven't yet been ported to ASM86 (should simply
    be a change of syntax)
